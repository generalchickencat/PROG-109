        <p>best spark-spitter of the Broken Cogg, and the last lady to sing for me when we were just scraps in the yard.  Here's to you, Cal.  You never sounded so good.</p>

        <h1>Eb's Newest Reviews News</h1>
        <h3>6/8/3018</h3>
        <p><em>Ebauchon has the newest round-up of Reviews for last year's collaboration albums up.  Check out some of the blurbs below:</em></p>

                <p class="albumtitle">Crustbox</p>
                <p class="albumnotes">"Crustbox doesn't open itself easily. This album is like homework (though not like Daft Punk's Homework). It's a study in noise, and requires patience. This is something that's going to click all of a sudden when you've thrown it on in the background on your millionth commute to work - you'll suddenly emerge on the other side of the hole in a bright place with a beautiful geometry only the few can see. Consider this level 11 stuff. One day, this album will be absolutely necessary."<br> -- <em>We Are Gazillions Issue 12 Vol. 2</em></p>

                <p class="albumtitle">Witchita Slayers</p>
                <p class="albumnotes">"This smash-bang collaboration with similarly coiffed DJ Pennyroyal (he of 1angreedwarf fame) is less peanut butter and chocolate and more chocolate with even more chocolate and washed down with a soda water from a Fizzie's secret stash (I suggest Dr. Pfeffer). Your teeth will rot and your pancreas will scream and you'll actually see time itself - and that's a good thing! Good for clearing out a room of assholes and seeing which ones remain. THOSE people are your real friends. <em>Witchita Slayers</em> slays, and not just in Foundation!"<br> -- <em>Hellworld Untd. Issue 2 Vol. 2</em></p>

                <p class="albumtitle">Defeat the Day</p>
                <p class="albumnotes">"... <em>Defeat the Day</em> is supposedly the third part of a rumored quadrilogy of records (preceded by last decade's <em>Languish the Earth</em> and <em>Kiss to Kill),</em> but the mood and genre shifts so drastically between records it's hard to give the theory credence. We were in gothic blues territory by way of Swedish death-songs in the last album, but here the spirit of Phil Collins-era Genesis thrives. It's as though bastard pop has pushed through to the other side and became something else. Call it what you want; I call this outstanding."<br> <em>-- Audiotheque Issue 6 Vol. 28</em></p>
