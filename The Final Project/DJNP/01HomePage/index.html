        I, I wish you could swim<br>
        Like the dolphins<br>
        Like dolphins can swim<br>

        We can beat them, forever and ever<br>

        We can be us just for one day<br>

        (I remember)<br>
        Standing by the wall<br>
        (By the wall)<br>
        And the guns, shot above our heads<br>
        (Over our heads)<br>
        And we kissed, as though nothing could fall<br>
        (Nothing could fall)<br>
        And the shame, was on the other side<br>
        Oh, we can beat them, forever and ever<br>
        Then we could be heroes just for one day<br>
        We can be heroes<br>

        A year is dissipating<br>
        Another hail cannot disdain<br>
        Nevermind the thunder<br>

        Dear Brothers and Sisters!<br>
        Dear Enemies and Friends!<br>
        Why are we all so alone here?<br>
        All we need is a little more hope,<br>
        a little more joy<br>
        All we need is a little more light,<br>
        a little less weight, a little more freedom<br>
        If we were an army, and if we believed<br>
        that we were an army<br>
        And we believed<br>
        That everyone was scared<br>
        Like little lost children in their<br>
        grown up clothes and poses<br>
        So we ended up alone here<br>
        Floating through long wasted days<br>
        Or great tribulations<br>
        While everything felt wrong<br>
        <br>
        Good words<br>
        Strong words<br>
        Words that could've moved mountains<br>
        Words that no one ever said<br>
        We were all waiting to hear those words<br>
        And no one ever said them<br>
        And the tactics never hatched.<br>
        And the plans were never mapped.<br>
        And we all learned not to believe.<br>
        And strange loathsome monsters <br>
        loafed through the hills<br>
        wondering why<br>
        And it is best to never ever<br>
        ever ever ever ever ever ever<br>
        ever ever wonder why<br>
        <br>
        So tangle; Oh tangle us up <br>
        in bright red ribbons!<br>
        Let's have a parade<br>
        It's been so long since we had a parade<br>
        So let's have a parade<br>
        Let's invite all our friends<br>
        And all our friends' friends<br>
        Let's promenade down the boulevards<br>
        With terrific pride<br>
        And light in our eyes<br>
        Twelve feet tall and staggering!<br>
        Sick with joy<br>
        With the angels there<br>
        And light in our eyes<br>
        Brothers and Sisters<br>
        Hope still waits in the wings<br>
        Like a bitter spinster<br>
        Impatient<br>
        Lonely<br>
        And shivering<br>
        Waiting to build her glorious fires.<br>
        It's because of our plans man;<br>
        Our beautiful ridiculous plans!<br>
        Let's launch them like careening jetplanes!<br>
        Let's crash all our planes in the river!<br>
        Let's build strange and radiant machines<br>
        At this Jericho waiting to fall<br>
