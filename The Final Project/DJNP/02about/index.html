    <!-- ABOUT: DJNickelPawn Backstory -->
        <h1>ABOUT THE DJ</h1>
        <p><em>MACHINESOUL/RABBITHOLE</em></p>
        <p>DJ Nicklepawn was uncovered by the Shoebox Rebellion over over one hundred and seventy years ago.  His hibernation had been long enough to wipe all memory of any life before being hidden.  Though the original chasis given to him was a series of temporary fragments slowly modified and upgraded by friends at the Broken Cogg, Nicklepawn eventually found favor with an elder Queen of the Zanthenum, and was gifted with the rare artifact of an old performance art chasis from before the Chaos Wars.  This unique form was a combination of zaithenoid and lepus, a perfectly machinae White Rabbit.</p>
        <p>Today DJ Nicklepawn is a resident of the Inner City once again, haunting the likes of New Arcadia, the Borderlands of Clover, and various underground shows in Freighton.</p>
