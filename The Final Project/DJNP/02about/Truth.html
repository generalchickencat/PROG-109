    <h1>Hi.</h1>
    <p class="robotocopy">
    What you've just discovered is the truth.  The truth about this site.  DJ Nickelpawn is a fictional character in a series of imagined ideas by artist and dreamer Graypawn.<br>
    DJ Nickelpawn has yet to appear as the main protagonist in any of their own stories, but they do appear prominently as a character in many of the tales about the magical metropolis called Metronox, aka "The Inner City."
    <br>
    This particular website is hosted via GitHub/GitPages, however, because the author, Graypawn, aka General Chickencat, aka Andy, is currently attending a web development class at Bellevue College.

    <h2>Shout Out to all my PROG 109 Peeps!  And to Maricel!</h2>
    
    <p  class="robotocopy">
    So enjoy the seemingly random collection of ideas - the majority of the chaos comes from the fact that this was originally supposed to be an online portfolio showcasing how far i've come learning to code for web development in just 7 weeks, thanks to PROG 109.  But, when given the chance to do something different with it, i asked our instructor, Maricel, if i could maybe create this fake website for DJ Nickelpawn instead.  I was given permission, and so, here you have it.
    <br>
    The vast majority of the links in Cx and Artifacts are in fact homework from this course.  Which is why a robot rabbit DJ in a magical urban fantasy realm would link you to, like, a kids mathematics demo.  Or a hotel page showing what rooms are booked, and <em>nothing else</em> about that hotel.

    <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>

    <p class="robotocopy">
    Before you wander off, though, i wanted to tell you this:  the three big lessons i learned in PROG 109.<br>
    Before i started this class i'd only ever worked with HTML for about a month in 1996.  So my knowledge of web development was a brief glimpse at primordial HTML.  I knew nothing of JavaScript or CSS.  I'm pretty sure they just didnt' exist back then.<br>
    <strong>1 - Do the Work</strong> and i don't mean, like, 'you have to get through the work' - that's just the turn of phrase i've been using to remind myself:  Get what Needs To Get Done Finished First.  I found out pretty quickly that this process can lead to infinite Rabbit Holes (part of why i was turned onto the notion of doing up a webpage for my favorite Robot Rabbit Friend).  And if you don't focus and do what <em>needs</em> to be done, you'll end up <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_triviality" target="_blank" alt="link to the Wiktionary Definition of the Law of Triviality">Bike Shedding</a> like crazy, until the sun's gone down and you're nearly dead.<br>
    <strong>2 - It's a Typo</strong> it's always a freaking typo.  Seriously.  Go check your work again.  Your logic is sound, the computer machine is doing what it's supposed to do.  It's a typo.  And that's throwing the whole thing off.<br>
    <strong>3 - You Won't Get There Till You Get There</strong> It bums me out bigtime, but one thing that this class made obvious:  i know enough about web dev now to be sloppy and overconfident.  And getting <em>good</em> with these tools is going to require doing more and more projects. It's just going to take time.  So stick to what you know, steal what code makes sense to you, and own where you're at.  You won't get good at this until you've put in the hours to be natural at it.  But when you get there, you'll be there.<br>
    <br>
    This whole portfolio was built from scratch, and while there are many challenges i can point at, the ones that stand out the most are:  a) getting the images to line up on the left and right of the screen via CSS.  b) getting the front page to move the little counters at the bottom to the side when you shrink the window size and c) supplying the creative content.  That last one is a big deal, too.  I can't tell you how crazy hard it was to parallel the act of <em>creative thinking</em> with <em>analytical deseign.</em>  It really drains you.<br>

    My two biggest take-aways from this class are 1) i'm really way more into web development than i ever could have expeted.  And 2) coding, especially when you get into proper languages like JavaScript, all seem to have a common source of thought.  I asked some professional coder friends about this, and my favorite reply was "The Latin you're looking for is Formal Logic and some Higher Maths."  Which totally makes sense.  When i realized the If function in JavaScript was eerily close to the If formula in Excel, i started to side-eye all of it.<br>

    So if you're about to join Maricel's team of ne'r-do-wells, my only suggestion is this:  do it during the regular season.  Not during the summer.  It's not nearly enough time to really enjoy all the aspects of the course.  Because the homework becomes a real sign of your progress, and the more time you give it the more fun you'll have.
