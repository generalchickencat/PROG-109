    <h1>Hi.</h1>
    <p class="robotocopy">
    What you've just discovered is the truth.  The truth about this site.  DJ Nickelpawn is a fictional character in a series of imagined ideas by artist and dreamer Graypawn.<br>
    DJ Nickelpawn has yet to appear as the main protagonist in any of their own stories, but they do appear prominently as a character in many of the tales about the magical metropolis called Metronox, aka "The Inner City."
    <br>
    This particular website is hosted via GitHub/GitPages, however, because the author, Graypawn, aka General Chickencat, aka Andy, is currently attending a web development class at Bellevue College.

    <h2>Shout Out to all my PROG 109 Peeps!  And to Maricel!</h2>
    
    <p  class="robotocopy">
    So enjoy the seemingly random collection of ideas - the majority of the chaos comes from the fact that this was originally supposed to be an online portfolio showcasing how far i've come learning to code for web development in just 7 weeks, thanks to PROG 109.  But, when given the chance to do something different with it, i asked our instructor, Maricel, if i could maybe create this fake website for DJ Nickelpawn instead.  I was given permission, and so, here you have it.
    <br>
    The vast majority of the links in Cx and Artifacts are in fact homework from this course.  Which is why a robot rabbit DJ in a magical urban fantasy realm would link you to, like, a kids mathematics demo.  Or a hotel page showing what rooms are booked, and <em>nothing else</em> about that hotel.
